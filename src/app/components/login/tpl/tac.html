    <h1 tabindex="-1">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
        The following subsections constitute a non-exhaustive excerpt of our general Terms of
        Service, which we think may be of use in the process of setting up the Service between
        educational institutions and TWICAPP INC.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Content Provider</h2>

    <p>
        The Site is a Social Learning Environment that serves to facilitate and promote education through
        synchronous audio and video learning products. Digital content ("Content") may consist of
        spoken word audio, information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics,
        video, messages or other materials.

        <br><br>

        Educational Institutions, their Students, or their agents sharing their work through the Site
        (“Content Providers”) retain their copyright in the Content. They do, however, grant
        TWICAPP INC the non-exclusive license right to post, display, copy, and distribute that Content
        within the limitations they set during the publishing process. TWICAPP INC also reserves a
        license right to excerpt their Content for use in marketing materials, providing that we credit
        them and/or the original author, and to make minor modifications to the Content for technical
        or editorial reasons. This will include TWICAPP INC’s right to offer free samples of the
        Content according to the Content Provider's specifications. If no specifications are given,
        TWICAPP INC reserves the right to create samples.

        <br><br>

        TWICAPP INC also reserves the right to make limited, royalty-free copies of the Content for
        the purposes of marketing and promotion such as the demonstration of system capabilities to
        potential Content Providers, investors and partners.

        <br><br>

        Content Providers sharing Content through the Site represent and warrant that the Content:

        </p><ul>

                Is owned by them, or to the extent owned by someone else, that they have obtained

                copying and distribution under the license in this Agreement;

                program, data, or personal information;
            </li>
            <li>
