        The following subsections constitute a non-exhaustive excerpt of our general Terms of 
        Service, which we think may be of use in the process of setting up the Service between 
        educational institutions and THE STUDNET.
    </p>
    
    <h2>1. Content Provider</h2>
    
    <p>
        The Site is a Social Learning Environment that serves to facilitate and promote education through 
        synchronous audio and video learning products. Digital content ("Content") may consist of 
        spoken word audio, information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, 
        video, messages or other materials.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Educational Institutions, their Students, or their agents sharing their work through the Site
        (“Content Providers”) retain their copyright in the Content. They do, however, grant THE 
        STUDNET the non-exclusive license right to post, display, copy, and distribute that Content 
        within the limitations they set during the publishing process. THE STUDNET also reserves a 
        license right to excerpt their Content for use in marketing materials, providing that we credit 
        them and/or the original author, and to make minor modifications to the Content for technical 
        or editorial reasons. This will include THE STUDNET’s right to offer free samples of the 
        Content according to the Content Provider's specifications. If no specifications are given, 
        THE STUDNET reserves the right to create samples.
        
        <br><br>
        
        THE STUDNET also reserves the right to make limited, royalty-free copies of the Content for 
        the purposes of marketing and promotion such as the demonstration of system capabilities to 
        potential Content Providers, investors and partners.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Content Providers sharing Content through the Site represent and warrant that the Content:
        
        </p><ul>
            <li>
                Is owned by them, or to the extent owned by someone else, that they have obtained
                that party's express permission to provide the Content to THE STUDNET for use, 
                copying and distribution under the license in this Agreement;                
            </li>

                abusive, inflammatory or otherwise objectionable,
            </li>
            <li>

                horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, or any other computer programming routines 
                that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, 
                program, data, or personal information;
            </li>
            <li>
                Does not break the law, facilitate the breaking of the law, or violate any applicable
                regulation or THE STUDNET rule or policy;
            </li>
            <li>
                Does not offer or disseminate fraudulent goods, services, schemes, or promotions, or

                as that found in advertising, promotions, or solicitations;
            </li>
            <li>
                That if any of the above representations and warranties set forth directly above
                are not true, that they will indemnify THE STUDNET for any breaches or 
                misrepresentations, takings or misappropriations, infringement or piracy of the 
                Content, including any and all damages, attorney’s fees and other expenses related to 
                any such misrepresentation or breach of warranty.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the best of their knowledge, all purported factual information in the Content they
                upload is true and accurate, and the use of any information in the Content will not 
                result in personal injury to any user. Content Providers are prohibited from using 
                Company to impersonate another person or entity. Despite all this, Company cannot 
                guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of the Content.
            </li>
        </ul>
