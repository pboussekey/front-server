        THE STUDNET provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures 
        regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of 
        www.twic.community.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide 
        to us through this Site.  
        <br><br>
        THE STUDNET Inc. and its affiliates are committed to protecting the privacy of its users. 
        Because THE STUDNET gathers certain types of information about the users of the Services, 
        we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the 
        information we collect. 
        <br><br>
        The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the 
        Services. Please make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter into 
        with parties other than THE STUDNET, including your educational institution, as those 
        policies may also explain how your personal information is used by those parties.
        <br><br>
        Please review the following statement to understand how the information you provide to THE 
        STUDNET through the Services will be treated.
    </p>
    
    <h2>1. Information THE STUDNET collects.</h2>
    
    <p>
        Our primary goals in collecting information are for THE STUDNET to provide and improve 
        the Site and enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.
        <br><br>
        When you register, we will request certain personal information, including, but not limited to, 
        contact information, such as your name, city and country demographic information such as 
        your age, gender as well as information about your education and professional experience. 
        <br><br>
        THE STUDNET gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users 
        visit most frequently and what services users access most often. THE STUDNET 
        automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to 
        the Services. We analyze these logs for marketing purposes as well as system performance 
        monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the aggregate trends they reveal about our customers 
        and how the customers use the Services, not for the behaviors of individual users.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. Log Data</h2>
    <p>
        When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends 
        whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”).&nbsp; This Log Data may include information such as 
        your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were 
        visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those 
        pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.&nbsp; We 
        use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Site’s technical 
        administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it 
        to our visitors’ needs.&nbsp; 
    </p>

    <h2>3. Phishing</h2>
    
    <p>
        Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to THE 
        STUDNET.&nbsp; Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our primary 
        concern.&nbsp;

        Internet servers hosting the Services. This information is primarily used to provide users of

        user statistics in order to describe the Services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other 
        third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

        to provide these features, it may be necessary for either you or us to share your personal 
        information with this company. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can 
        choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular feature.

        but not limited to customer support and data analytics. THE STUDNET requires these 
        companies to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information and prohibits them 
        from using the information for any other purpose than the purpose for which it was collected.
