        TWICAPP INC provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures
        regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of
        www.twic.community.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide
        to us through this Site.
        <br><br>
        TWICAPP INC Inc. and its affiliates are committed to protecting the privacy of its users.
        Because TWICAPP INC gathers certain types of information about the users of the Services,
        we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the
        information we collect.
        <br><br>
        The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the
        Services. Please make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter into
        with parties other than TWICAPP INC, including your educational institution, as those
        policies may also explain how your personal information is used by those parties.
        <br><br>
        Please review the following statement to understand how the information you provide to
        TWICAPP INC through the Services will be treated.

    <h2>1. Information TWICAPP INC collects.</h2>

    <p>
        Our primary goals in collecting information are for TWICAPP INC to provide and improve
        the Site and enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.
        <br><br>
        When you register, we will request certain personal information, including, but not limited to,

        <br><br>
        TWICAPP INC gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users
        visit most frequently and what services users access most often. TWICAPP INC
        automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to
        the Services. We analyze these logs for marketing purposes as well as system performance
        monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the aggregate trends they reveal about our customers
        and how the customers use the Services, not for the behaviors of individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Log Data</h2>
    <p>
        When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends
        whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”).&nbsp; This Log Data may include information such as

        visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those
        pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.&nbsp; We
        use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Site’s technical
        administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it
        to our visitors’ needs.&nbsp;
